# COBOL

Tier 1: Beginner (Syntax & Legacy Literacy)
Subjects

COBOL program structure (IDENTIFICATION / DATA / PROCEDURE)

PIC clauses

MOVE, ADD, SUBTRACT

IF / EVALUATE

PERFORM

Sequential file processing

Basic DISPLAY / ACCEPT

Compile & run basics

🧠 This is learning to read and write basic COBOL.

Tier 2: Intermediate (Enterprise Application COBOL)

👉 This is where most working COBOL devs live

Subjects

Indexed & relative files

VSAM (KSDS, ESDS, RRDS)

Copybooks

Modular programs

Error handling

Batch job logic

Mainframe data types (COMP, COMP-3)

Date & numeric processing

Performance-conscious loops

🧠 This is real business COBOL.

Tier 3: Advanced (Mainframe Systems COBOL)
Subjects

Embedded SQL (DB2)

CICS (online transaction processing)

JCL integration

Transaction rollback & recovery

Program reentrancy

Memory management awareness

File locking & concurrency

Debugging production dumps

🧠 This is production-critical COBOL.

⚠️ Most people stop here.

Still not the top.

Tier 4: Expert (Mainframe Architecture & Optimization)
Subjects

z/OS internals

COBOL compiler internals

Load modules & linkage editor

Address spaces

Storage management (HEAP vs STACK)

Abend analysis

SMF & performance tuning

DB2 access path optimization

CICS performance tuning

Large-scale batch scheduling (CA-7, Control-M)

🧠 This is running the bank.
